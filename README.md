# ionq_adder
Adding numbers on IONQ Forte using a [standard qiskit ripple carry adder](https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs/en/api/qiskit/qiskit.circuit.library.CDKMRippleCarryAdder) 
```
2k + 2 = 36
2k = 34
k = 17
```
17 bit addition

Furthermore the information is classically separable, leading  to a hybrid classical-quantum architecture. Classical memory can store intermediary and final results for arbitrary N-bit number addition using an arbitrary amount of classical memory and a full adder configuration.
